	    		+ "To capture the flag you use your army of 40 pieces. "
	    		+ "Pieces have a rank and represent individual officers \nand "
	    		+ "soldiers in an army. In addition to those ranked pieces you "
	    		+ "can use bombs to protect your flag.\n\n"

	    		+ "Pieces cannot jump over another piece. "

	    		+ "onto a square already occupied by another piece without "

	    		+ "The bombs and the flag cannot be moved. A bomb defeats every piece "
	    		+ "that tries to attack it, except the miner. The flag loses from every\n "
	    		+ "other piece. When you capture the flag of your opponent you win the game.\n\n"
